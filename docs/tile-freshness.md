# Tile freshness: how the device learns a tile it already has went stale

**Status 2026-08-09: `MapTileReader::contentId()` is implemented and tested.
Nothing calls it yet** -- the settings, the BLE exchange and the fetch trigger
are not built. This documents the signal and why it is that signal, so the rest
can be built against something settled.

Laptop side lives in the parent repo: `docs/tile-index-spec.md` (the index
format), `mapbuilder/tile_index.py`, `mapbuilder/tools/build_index.py`.

## The problem

The firmware only ever fetches a tile it is **missing**. `MapTileSource` records
a tile as missing when the reader fails to open it or it holds no geometry
(`src/activities/map/MapTileSource.cpp:134-145`, `docs/missing-tiles.md`). A
tile that opens fine and has geometry is treated as good forever, no matter how
many times the map is rebuilt.

So the railway/tram fix -- a classification bug that drew a tram line as a
mainline railway -- was fixed, the area was rebuilt and republished, and every
device that had already synced kept the wrong tile. Permanently.

## The signal: `contentId()`

```
content_id = crc32( 6 x u32 LE per-layer crc32, in layer id order 1..6 )
```

`MapTileReader::contentId()`, `src/activities/map/MapTileReader.cpp`. Verified
bit-for-bit against mapbuilder's `content_id_from_layer_crcs()` over real
fixture tiles (`test/map_tile_reader/MapTileReaderGoldenTest.cpp`,
`ContentIdMatchesMapbuilder`).

**It costs nothing.** `parseHeader()` already reads the whole layer directory
and keeps every layer's crc32 in `layers_[i].crc32`
(`src/activities/map/MapTileReader.h`). `contentId()` is arithmetic over values
that are already in RAM -- no seek, no read, no extra flash.

**It needs no format change.** That matters more than it sounds: a tile whose
`format_version` does not match is refused at open
(`src/activities/map/MapTileReader.cpp`, the version check in `parseHeader()`),
which hatches it and records it missing. So bumping the format to carry a new
field would make **every tile on every card** look missing at once and force a
full re-download over BLE at ~7.4 kB/s. The per-layer crc32s are already there.

## Why not the timestamps in the header

Both were tried on the laptop side first and both were wrong. Measured, not
argued:

| signal | what it does | why it fails |
|---|---|---|
| `osmEpoch()` | time of the OSM extract | **Does not move when only the build rules change.** A rules rebuild runs from the same cached extract. Measured over Karlova Ves: a genuine rule change left `osm_epoch` identical on all 10 tiles while the geometry changed on all 10. This is the exact case the feature exists for. |
| `buildEpoch()` | time of the build | Moves on **every** build, including one that produces identical geometry. Comparing it re-downloads a continent to change nothing. |

The per-layer crc32s cover geometry and nothing else -- no epoch, no coordinates
-- so they move if and only if what the tile draws moved, whichever cause did
it. One signal, both reasons.

`buildEpoch()` is still worth keeping for display ("this tile last changed in
March"). It is not the comparison.

### Consequence: no "never downgrade" rule

The laptop-side spec used to say a device holding a newer tile must never be
downgraded. That existed only because time was the signal. With content
identity the CDN is simply the source of truth: content differs, take the CDN's
copy. A deliberate rollback is then followed correctly instead of ignored.

## How the check will work (not built yet)

The device does **not** read the index. That was decided rather than defaulted:
an on-device reader means seek/offset arithmetic in firmware and a
world-sized index mirrored onto one SD card, for a check the phone can already
do. Same division of labour the missing-tile fetch already uses -- the device
asks, the phone fetches from the CDN.

1. Device sends `(z, col, row, content_id)` for tiles it holds, gathered where
   `drawMapLayers()` already opens them (`src/activities/map/MapActivity.cpp`)
   -- no extra I/O, same trick `MissingTilesStore` plays for absent tiles.
2. Phone byte-range reads the matching slots out of the CDN's `.idx` and answers
   which differ. One range request for a viewport, not one per tile: the slots
   are contiguous in the row-major plane.
3. Differing tiles join the existing fetch. The phone requests them with the
   expected content id in the URL (`?crc=<content_id>`), which makes each
   version its own CDN cache key -- the tile path does not change when a tile is
   rebuilt, and the edge caches for 7 days.

### Two things the implementation must not get wrong

**Stale tiles do not belong in `MissingTilesStore`.** Its records are persisted
(`z/col/row/count`, `src/MissingTilesStore.cpp`) even though the in-memory
`refused` flag is not. A stale entry written there would survive a reboot and
the device would then ask the phone for a tile it already has. Its eviction is
also by `count`, so fresh stale entries are dropped first -- and in a live
check, a stream of them would push out genuinely missing tiles. Keep a separate
in-memory list.

**A stale fetch that does not fix the tile must stop asking.** If the arriving
tile still does not match the index, mark it and do not re-check it. Without
that, a cache serving an old copy turns a live check into an endless
fetch loop with real battery behind it.
